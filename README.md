## I am working on

making the world a better place.

I chose computer science as my area of expertise because it can be applied everywhere - and everyone can benefit from it.

My pet project is [EcoRE](https://github.com/nijakow/EcoRE), a programming environment inspired by the power and flexibility of **Smalltalk** and **Self**. Over the years I have implemented multiple versions of it, and I keep refining the mechanisms to make it as compact and flexible as possible.

## My favorite programming languages
 - 🪄 **Lisp** (of course)
 - 🔧 **C**
 - 🎈 **Smalltalk**
 - 🪜 **FORTH**
 - 🦀 **Rust**
